# Behind the scenes
These days, Israel is using the blockade as a tool in the war of extermination it has been waging on the Gaza Strip since October 7, 2023. No water, food, or fuel is entering the Gaza Strip. Israel is also preventing the entry of liquidity, preventing people there from purchasing the food, drink, and other basic necessities they need to survive. Israel is also adopting the same approach in the West Bank, but in a systematic manner, impoverishing people and demolishing their homes as a prelude to their displacement from their land. In fact, what prompted me to consider such a project was to support my people as much as possible, as they live on the bare necessities of life. I have often seen people dying for a living amid difficult economic conditions, few job opportunities, and high unemployment rates. For example, my father worked in construction and died after falling from the eighth floor while working for little money.

# Purpose
Alleviating people's suffering, providing an alternative to the Israeli currency used locally, and providing safe and reliable ways to financially support my people by leveraging the cryptocurrency system.

# Concept
The creation of a stable cryptocurrency similar to USDT, operating on a decentralized system, similar to existing currencies such as Bitcoin, Solana, and Litecoin. The idea here is to link the wallet address to a real person's ID. However, this can only be achieved by relying on a central system, such as an organization or a country, to create a certificate of ownership for the wallet and distribute financial aid to a targeted group, such as orphans, women, men, or a combination of options selected by the donor. These processes are carried out in a transparent, clear and secure manner, and are published publicly and can be audited by anyone.

# Additions to Concept
To make the platform more secure against fraud and internal corruption, it must inform each country of the data on the wallets registered in that country, and obtain continuous audits from countries regarding the truth of the people affiliated with that country to avoid corruption in the centralization of creating ownership certificates for wallets.

# Usable prebuilt blockchain infrastructures
- Stellar's consensus mechanism works in a simple yet effective way, but because of this, anyone can join the network. Therefore, using this mechanism requires a central authority to allow a specific device or person to join and contribute to securing the network. Otherwise, the network becomes vulnerable to blocking and other problems that make it unsafe and unreliable, given that anyone can join from any device around the world without restrictions, and by activating a central authority that can verify the identity of participants and legally punish those who misuse the network. this approach is used and implemented in PI Network

- Solana's consensus mechanism: It is characterized by high speed compared to other cryptocurrencies and low transaction fees, which complements a project like this, given the large volume of daily transactions. However, this mechanism comes with a very high level of risk, as anyone can join the network. This makes it vulnerable to hacking, network disruption, and forks, which could be carried out by organized groups or even countries, particularly Israel.

# Technical aspects
Coming soon

# Final thoughts
The concept has limitations, mostly from current blockchain and consensus mechanisms, however this doesn't prevent a trusted and known organizations from implementing a hybrid or new consensus mechanism. in fact Stellar's consensus mechanism is a good fit, but it cannot be done by a newbie organization due to low reputation, but big known non profit organizations can do it, it may also be community driven.
